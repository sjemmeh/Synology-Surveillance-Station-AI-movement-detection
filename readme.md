# Synology movement AI detection - WIP
### I tried multiple solutions, but none were working to my specification, so I decided to just write it myself
## Setup:
* Docker:
  * Edit the settings.json file - Currently the only supported notifier is a webhook (I use a home assistant automation)
  * Run the container

* Local:
  * Set up a [Codeproject AI server](https://www.codeproject.com)
  * Edit the settings.json file - Currently the only supported notifier is a webhook (I use a home assistant automation)
  * Install the requirements
  * Run the main.py file
